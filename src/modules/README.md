### Welcome to the `module` directory!

Here you can place your components that are tight to your business application requirements.

For example, if you allow some kind of User Navigation / Authentication actions and want to create a _navigation sidebar_ or a _user dropdown_ consider adding an `auth` or `navigation` module.

**Same applies for all specific needs, usually components places here are only reusable within the module itself and just a phew of them being exported to be consumed by your `app`**

`modules` directory makes sense for scaling applications, with new _app-router_ `app` folder, we could also place components there. It's up to you if you want to keep this directory, or not.
